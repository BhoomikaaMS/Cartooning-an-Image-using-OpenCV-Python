# Cartooning-an-Image-using-OpenCV-Python
A Data Science project using OpenCV and Python to cartoonize images. It involves image downscaling, bilateral filtering, grayscale conversion, median blur, and adaptive thresholding to detect edges and create a sketch effect, resulting in a smooth, colorful, cartoon-like output using Computer Vision techniques.
